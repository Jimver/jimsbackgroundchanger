Background changer that changes depending on resolution

Use cases:
You have an external monitor for your laptop which has a different resolution than your laptop screen.
When you plug in your laptop and dont use the laptop screen and use the external monitor as your primary monitor then the wallpaper will change depending on the chosen folder(s) for that resolution.

Still WIP.
